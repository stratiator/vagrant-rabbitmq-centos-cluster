      # To include or exclude containers based on their tags, use the include and
      # exclude keys in your instance.
      # The reasoning is: if a tag matches an exclude rule, it won't be included
      # unless it also matches an include rule.
      #
      # Examples:
      #
      # exclude all, except ubuntu and debian.
      # include:
      #   - "image:ubuntu"
      #   - "image:debian"
